# newrelic-instrumentations
This repo contains custom New Relic instrumentations that does not require the usage of Java API or annotations in your Java code. To deploy, copy the "extensions" folder into the agent's "newrelic" folder; and then change the owner of the directory to the appropriate user.

To view the JMX metrics, refer to New Relic's instructions here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/custom-jmx-instrumentation-yaml#display_metrics
